# Federated Learning Pipeline Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the federated learning (FL) implementation in the Security Evaluation System (SES). The federated learning pipeline enables collaborative machine learning across multiple organizations while preserving data privacy and security.

## Two Implementation Approaches

The SES federated learning system provides two complementary implementations for different learning objectives:

### Simple Implementation: `fl_trainer_simple.py`

- **Purpose**: Understanding core FL concepts and quick experiments
- **Algorithm**: FedAvg (Federated Averaging) - the foundational FL algorithm
- **Features**: Minimal complexity, clear code structure, fast execution
- **Use Cases**: Learning FL fundamentals, quick demos, proof-of-concept testing
- **File Location**: `backend/fl/src/fl_trainer_simple.py`

### Advanced Implementation: `fl_trainer.py`

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive FL research and experimentation
- **Algorithms**: Multiple aggregation strategies (weighted, median, secure)
- **Features**: Differential privacy, comprehensive metrics, detailed analysis
- **Use Cases**: Advanced FL research, comparison studies, privacy experiments
- **File Location**: `backend/fl/src/fl_trainer.py`

Both implementations enable distributed neural network training across multiple clients while preserving data privacy through collaborative learning without raw data sharing.

## Overview

## Federated Learning Concepts and Real-World Applications

### Understanding Federated Learning

Federated Learning allows multiple parties (clients) to train a shared machine learning model without sharing their raw data. Instead of sending data to a central server, each client:

1. **Trains locally** on their own data
2. **Shares only model updates** (not raw data)
3. **Receives an improved global model** back
4. **Repeats** for multiple communication rounds

This preserves privacy while enabling collaborative learning!

### Real-World Applications

These experiments simulate scenarios like:

- 🏥 **Healthcare**: Hospitals training on patient data without sharing records
- 🏦 **Finance**: Banks improving fraud detection without sharing transactions
- 📱 **Mobile**: Smartphones learning from usage without uploading personal data
- 🏢 **Enterprise**: Companies collaborating on security models while keeping data private

### Key Federated Learning Concepts

#### Data Heterogeneity (Non-IID)

Real-world FL clients have different data distributions:

- **IID**: All clients have similar data (easier to train)
- **Non-IID**: Clients have different data patterns (more realistic, harder)

#### Communication Efficiency

- **Communication Cost**: Sending model updates uses bandwidth
- **Local Computation**: More local training reduces communication
- **Tradeoff**: Balance communication frequency vs local training depth

#### Privacy Protection

- **Model Updates**: Can still leak some information about training data
- **Differential Privacy**: Adds noise to protect individual data points
- **Secure Aggregation**: Advanced cryptographic protection (not implemented here)

## Federated Learning Architecture

### Core Components

The FL system consists of several key components that work together to enable distributed training:

- **Client Management**: Handles multiple data sources representing different organizations
- **Local Training**: Individual model training on client-specific data
- **Model Aggregation**: Combines client models using various strategies
- **Global Distribution**: Shares updated global model back to clients
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors convergence and model quality

### FL Workflow

    G --> H{More Rounds?}
    H -->|Yes| C
    H -->|No| I[Final Evaluation]
```

## Dataset Generation (`generate_fl_datasets`)

The FL system creates multiple datasets representing different clients with varying data distributions, simulating real-world federated scenarios.

### Client Data Diversity

```python
def generate_fl_datasets(
    num_clients: int = 4,
    samples_per_client: int = 200,
    excellent_base: float = 0.25,
    excellent_step: float = 0.1,
) -> List[Dict[str, Path]]:
```

**Parameters:**

- **num_clients**: Number of participating organizations (default: 4)
- **samples_per_client**: Local dataset size per client (default: 200)
- **excellent_base**: Starting bias toward excellent configurations (default: 0.25)
- **excellent_step**: Bias increment between clients (default: 0.1)

**Data Distribution Strategy:**

Each client receives a unique bias toward excellent security configurations:

- **Client 0**: 25% excellent bias (more poor/fair configurations)
- **Client 1**: 35% excellent bias (balanced distribution)
- **Client 2**: 45% excellent bias (good/excellent focus)
- **Client 3**: 55% excellent bias (primarily excellent configurations)

This heterogeneous distribution simulates real-world scenarios where different organizations have varying security maturity levels.

### Expert System Integration

```python
expert_system = SecurityExpertSystem()
for i in range(num_clients):
    bias = excellent_base + i * excellent_step
    data = generate_dataset(expert_system, samples_per_client, bias)
```

Each client dataset is generated using the CLIPS expert system with different bias parameters, ensuring:

- **Consistent Labeling**: All clients use the same expert system for ground truth
- **Data Diversity**: Different organizations have realistic security patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Expert system ensures valid metric combinations

## Model Aggregation Strategies

The FL system implements multiple aggregation methods to combine client models, each suited for different scenarios and requirements.

**Note**: The advanced `fl_trainer.py` focuses on comprehensive aggregation methods. For basic FedAvg (simple averaging), use `fl_trainer_simple.py`.

### 1. FedAvg (Simple Average) - `fl_trainer_simple.py`

Basic parameter averaging across all clients (straightforward implementation):

```python
def fedavg_aggregate(client_models: List[Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
    """FedAvg: Simple averaging of client model parameters."""
    # Average each parameter across all clients
    for param_name in client_models[0].keys():
        stacked_params = torch.stack([client_model[param_name].float()
                                     for client_model in client_models])
        global_model[param_name] = stacked_params.mean(dim=0)
    return global_model
```

**Characteristics:**

- **Democratic**: All clients contribute equally
- **Simple**: Straightforward implementation for learning
- **Foundational**: Perfect for understanding core FL concepts

### 2. Weighted Average Aggregation (`aggregate_weighted`) - `fl_trainer.py`

Parameter averaging with client-specific weights (advanced implementation):

```python
def aggregate_weighted(
    states: List[Dict[str, torch.Tensor]],
    weights: List[float]
) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
    """Aggregate model states using weighted average."""
    total = sum(weights)
    agg = {}
    for k in states[0].keys():
        stacked = torch.stack([s[k].float() * w for s, w in zip(states, weights)])
        agg[k] = stacked.sum(dim=0) / total
    return agg
```

**Weight Strategies:**

- **Data Size Weighting**: Larger datasets get more influence
- **Performance Weighting**: Better-performing clients contribute more
- **Default Method**: Used as default in `fl_trainer.py`

### 3. Median Aggregation (`aggregate_median`) - `fl_trainer.py`

Robust aggregation using parameter medians:

```python
def aggregate_median(states: List[Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
    """Aggregate model states using element-wise median."""
    agg = {}
    for k in states[0].keys():
        agg[k] = torch.stack([s[k].float() for s in states]).median(dim=0).values
    return agg
```

**Advantages:**

- **Outlier Resistance**: Robust against malicious or corrupted clients
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Maintains performance with some faulty clients
- **Stability**: Less sensitive to extreme parameter values

### 4. Secure Aggregation (`aggregate_secure_average`) - `fl_trainer.py`

Advanced aggregation with optional differential privacy:

```python
def aggregate_secure_average(
    states: List[Dict[str, torch.Tensor]],
    add_noise: bool = False,
    noise_scale: float = 0.001,
) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
    """Secure aggregation with optional differential privacy."""
```

**Privacy Features:**

- **Optional Differential Privacy**: Adds calibrated noise when enabled
- **Gradient Clipping**: Bounds parameter magnitudes
- **Privacy Budget**: Controls privacy-utility tradeoff

## Federated Training Process (`federated_training`)

The main training function orchestrates the complete FL workflow across multiple rounds.

### Advanced Training Configuration (`fl_trainer.py`)

```python
def federated_training(
    dataset_paths: List[Dict[str, Path]],
    rounds: int = 5,
    local_epochs: int = 5,
    aggregation: str = "weighted",  # Advanced default
    hidden_size: int = 128,
    hidden_layers: int = 3,
    batch_size: int = 16,
    use_differential_privacy: bool = False,
    noise_scale: float = 0.001,
    verbose: bool = True,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

**Key Parameters:**

- **rounds**: Number of FL communication rounds (default: 5)
- **local_epochs**: Training epochs per client per round (default: 5)
- **aggregation**: "weighted" (default), "median", or "secure"
- **hidden_layers**: Neural network depth (default: 3)
- **use_differential_privacy**: Enable privacy protection (default: False)
- **verbose**: Detailed logging of training progress

### Simple Training Configuration (`fl_trainer_simple.py`)

```python
def simple_federated_training(
    dataset_paths: List[Dict[str, Path]],
    rounds: int = 5,
    local_epochs: int = 3,
    hidden_size: int = 64,
    batch_size: int = 16,
    verbose: bool = True,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

**Simplified Parameters:**

- **Fixed aggregation**: Only FedAvg (simple averaging)
- **Fewer local_epochs**: Default 3 for faster demos
- **Smaller hidden_size**: Default 64 for efficiency
- **Learning focus**: Minimal complexity

### Training Round Workflow

Each FL round follows this sequence:

1. **Local Model Distribution**

   ```python
   # Each client starts with current global model
   for client_idx, client in enumerate(clients):
       local_model = create_model(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
       local_model.load_state_dict(global_state)
   ```

2. **Parallel Local Training**

   ```python
   # Clients train independently on local data
   local_states = []
   for client in clients:
       local_state = _train_local(local_model, train_loader, local_epochs, device, learning_rate)
       local_states.append(local_state)
   ```

3. **Model Parameter Aggregation**

   ```python
   # Combine client models using selected strategy
   if aggregation_method == "average":
       global_state = aggregate_average(local_states)
   elif aggregation_method == "weighted":
       weights = [len(client_data) for client_data in clients]
       global_state = aggregate_weighted(local_states, weights)
   # ... other methods
   ```

4. **Global Model Evaluation**

   ```python
   # Test aggregated model on all client test sets
   global_metrics = evaluate_federated_model(global_model, client_test_paths, device)
   ```

5. **Performance Tracking**

   ```python
   # Record metrics for analysis
   history["round"].append(round_num + 1)
   history["global_mse"].append(global_metrics["global_mse"])
   history["avg_local_mse"].append(global_metrics["avg_local_mse"])
   ```

## Privacy and Security Features

### Differential Privacy (`add_differential_privacy_noise`)

The system implements differential privacy to protect individual client data:

```python
def add_differential_privacy_noise(
    state: Dict[str, torch.Tensor],
    noise_scale: float = 0.001,
    clip_norm: float = 1.0
) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
    """Add calibrated noise for differential privacy."""
```

**Privacy Mechanisms:**

- **Gradient Clipping**: Bounds sensitivity of individual contributions
- **Noise Addition**: Gaussian noise scaled to privacy requirements
- **Privacy Budget**: Tracks cumulative privacy loss across rounds

### Model Similarity Tracking (`calculate_model_similarity`)

Monitors model convergence and potential attacks:

```python
def calculate_model_similarity(
    state1: Dict[str, torch.Tensor],
    state2: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]
) -> float:
    """Calculate cosine similarity between model states."""
```

**Security Applications:**

- **Convergence Monitoring**: Detect when models stabilize
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual parameter changes
- **Attack Detection**: Spot potential model poisoning attempts

## Results Analysis and Interpretation

### Understanding Your Results

    dataset_paths=client_datasets,
    rounds=10,
    aggregation_method="secure"
)
```

### Model Deployment

Trained federated models can be deployed directly in the security evaluation system:
