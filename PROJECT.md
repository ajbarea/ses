# Project Title: AI‑Powered Computer Security Evaluation System

Course Context and Overview
This project is a major component of the course, accounting for half of the overall grade. Teams of up to three students (or individuals) will design and build a prototype AI application that evaluates the security posture of the Windows 11 environment on which it runs. You’ll explore multiple AI/ML paradigms—beginning with rule‑based expert systems and culminating in data‑driven neural models—over a compact three‑ to four‑week schedule. Enrollment in groups via MyCourses (first‑come basis, max three members) is required before submissions are accepted; late work will incur penalties and no submissions are permitted after June 26th .

Objectives and Deliverables
Establish Security Metrics

Conduct a focused literature review on expert systems and software security.

Select measurable system attributes (e.g., patch status, open ports, running services) that can serve as evaluation criteria.

Design a Rule‑Based Expert System

Architect a classic rule engine to apply human‑readable “if‑then” evaluations against the chosen metrics.

Define a rule language or leverage CLIPS/PyCLIPS to encode security policies.

Implement and Test the Prototype

Develop the expert system in your chosen environment (e.g., Python + CLIPS, C++).

Execute scans on a Windows 11 host to gather live metrics and apply rules, producing a security assessment report.

Integrate Machine Learning

Use data collected from the rule‑based prototype to train neural networks (e.g., in TensorFlow or PyTorch).

Compare ML‑derived evaluations with rule‑based results and refine models to detect nuanced security anomalies.

Timeline and Milestones
Week 1 – 2 (Research & Requirements): Complete the literature review, finalize metrics, and submit a brief report outlining your chosen evaluation criteria.

Week 2 – 3 (Design & Rule Authoring): Deliver a design document and rule specification for the expert system.

Week 3 – 4 (Prototype Implementation): Submit a working prototype that scans a Windows 11 machine, applies rules, and generates a security evaluation.

By June 26th (Final Integration): Incorporate the machine‑learning component, submit source code, a final report comparing methods, and a demo. Early submissions are encouraged; any work received after June 26th will not be accepted.

Team Organization and Tools
Team Size: 1–3 students; enroll on MyCourses under “Groups” immediately.

Implementation Platforms: Choose among Python, C++, CLIPS/PyCLIPS, TensorFlow, or PyTorch according to your team’s expertise.

Grading Scheme: Four graded deliverables aligned with the milestones above (see Attachment 1 on MyCourses for detailed rubric). Late submissions incur penalties; final deadline is firm.

Expected Outcomes
 By project end, you will have:
A comprehensive understanding of rule‑based versus data‑driven security evaluation techniques.

A modular prototype capable of assessing Windows 11 security through both explicit policy rules and learned patterns.

Experience managing a rapid AI/ML development cycle—from literature survey through design, coding, and evaluation.
